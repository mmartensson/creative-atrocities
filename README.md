Creative Atrocities
===================

This game is meant to be played together with two or more players, seated around a device (typically a tablet)
which assumes the role of controller / card table. Each player uses a
[QR code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
provided by the controller to fire up a web page on their smartphone which takes on the role of a hand of cards.
